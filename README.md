Rough version of library I made for visualizing 2D vectors (linear algebra), inspired by [Vector.js](https://vectorjs.org).


Goal: simple diagrams of interactive 2D vectors on a Cartesian grid


Current abilities:
- Graph simple vectors that can be resized
- Vector labels auto-update
- Easily add sum and difference vectors
- "Mirror" vectors across grids

See demo

Motivation: 
- Demonstrating vectors for articles (eg https://blog.shalvah.me/posts/learn-svg-by-drawing-an-arrow)
- Visualizing School work

Inspirations:
- https://vectorjs.org/
- https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tools/interactivesvgjs/
- https://github.com/ksassnowski/vueclid (which I'll probably switch to using)
