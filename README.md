Thus far:
- `makeArrow`: draw a arrow to a point
- `makeVector`: draw a resizable vector using `makeArrow`, with name and coordinates shown
- grid shows y and x-axes lines
- grid has origin in center

todo:
- show points on the axes
- label the axes
- invert grid y-direction
- show grid lines
- snap to grid lines
